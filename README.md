# Smart Light Project
By Anindit Dewan

Welcome to my project using the ESP-IDF (Espressif Systems IoT Development Framework). 

This project is a smart light automation tool that allows users to control lights (whether it be an LED, or DC light bulb) using a web interface. There are various characteristics that the user can control about the lights such as allowing flickering, a certain brightness percentage they would like, timing the light to be on for certain intervals, and even adjusting the light based on the temperature in the room. 

## Skills & Technologies Used
* PWM for controlling light brightness and flickering  
* Timer for controlling time light will stay on
* Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) for creation of web server 
* I2C protocol for communication with temperature sensor (BME280) 
* SPIFFS for storing HTML & CSS pages  
* Git for version control
* Breadboarding & Wiring

## User Installation 
1. Clone the github repository 
2. Ensure that ESP-IDF is installed on your computer, this can be done by by installing the extension on Visual Studio Code if on Windows. 
3. Open ESP-IDF terminal and enter `idf.py menuconfig` to open ESP-IDF configuration menu 
4. Go to Partition Table → Partition Table → Custom partition table CSV → write `partitions.csv` → Press "S" to save 
5. Then go to the front page → Serial flasher config → Flash size → 4+ MB → Press "S" to save 
6. Finally go back to the front page again → Component config → HTTPs Server → Set Max HTTP Header Request Length to `1024`
7. Escape/exit ESP-IDF configuration menu 
8. Enter `idf.py -p COMx flash monitor` to build, flash and open device monitor on the USB (`COMx`) port of your choice. 

## Current Work
* Improve UI of Website 
* Integrate OLED Display for Temperature Sensor
