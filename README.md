# Smart Light Project

Welcome to my project using the ESP-IDF (Espressif Systems IoT Development Framework). 

This project is a smart light automation tool that allows users to control lights (whether it be an LED, or DC light bulb) using a web interface. There are various characteristics that the user can control about the lights such as allowing flickering, a certain brightness percentage they would like, timing the light to be on for certain intervals, and even adjusting the light based on the temperature in the room. 

## Skills & Technologies Used
* PWM for controlling light brightness and flickering  
* Timer for controlling time light will stay on
* Wi-Fi for creation of web server 
* I2C for communication with temperature sensor (BME280) 
* SPIFFS for storing HTML & CSS pages  
* Git for version control
* Breadboarding & Wiring
